LGBTQIA+ Countries are also the Happiest? Statistics Analysis and Tableau Dashboards

To answer this question, the project aims to analyze and establish a correlation between the level of happiness and the LGBTQIA+ Rights in European countries. The project uses data sets from rainbow-europe and worldhappiness.report to achieve this objective.

The data sets were cleaned to decide which metrics were relevant to the case study. The categorical data from the rainbow-europe table was transformed into numerical data to generate a score based on the number of legislation laws approved in European countries.

After cleaning the data sets, they were joined to create a unique table that contained all the necessary data. The correlation between the variables was determined using a heatmap. The main objective was to predict if a country was LGBTQIA+ friendly or not based on its happiness score.

Finally, a linear regression model was applied to the collected results, and a dashboard was created in Tableau that contained all the relevant information. The dashboard can be accessed using the link provided, and all the data used in the project is available in the repository.

The dashboard can be access here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/igor.hufnagel/viz/AHappyCountryismoreLGBTQIAFriendly/Dashboard?publish=yes
